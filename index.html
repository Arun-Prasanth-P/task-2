        <h2>Rebel Poet</h2>
        <p>
          Kazi Nazrul Islam is the national poet of Bangladesh who is
          especially<br />
          recognized as a Bidrohi Kobi (rebel poet) around the country.
          Nazrul<br />
          is a famous poet, musician and philosopher of Bangladesh. The
          famous<br />
          poet Nazrul’s writings deal with the revolution of that period of
          the<br />
          British government. His revolutionary attempt helped him to be a<br />
          national poet of Bangladesh. He has raised his voice against any
          kinds<br />
          of fascism and oppression and got popularity swiftly around the
          Indian<br />
          Subcontinent.

          <p>
            Nazrul’s writings explored themes such as love, freedom, humanity,
            and<br />
            revolution. He opposed all forms of bigotry and fundamentalism,<br />
            including religious, caste-based and gender-based. Throughout his<br />
            career, Nazrul wrote short stories, novels, and essays but is
            best<br />
            known for his songs and poems. He pioneered new music forms such
            as<br />
            Bengali ghazals. Nazrul wrote and composed music for nearly 4,000<br />
            songs (many recorded on HMV and gramophone records), collectively<br />
            known as Nazrul Geeti.
